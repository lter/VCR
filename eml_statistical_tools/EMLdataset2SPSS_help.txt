EMLdataset2SPSS.xsl - John Porter 9/8/2005

EMLdataset2SPSS.xsl is an XML Stylesheet, that when used with an XML processor such as xalan, creates a program for the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).

CAPABILITIES:

GET DATA statement automatically populated with attribute and format information.

Automatically provides labels for variables (attributes) and values (codes).

Sets up MISSING VALUE statements

Basic statistical analyses of frequencies and descriptive statistics are provided

A quality assurance listing consisting of range checks is also included. 


LIMITATIONS: 

The underlying data file must be text, in either a fixed column or delimited column format. 

The EML document must include at least one "dataTable" that in turn includes both "attributeList" and "physical" nodes.  

The user still needs to edit the resulting program file to add the path to the data file on the local system. 

Handling of dates may be unreliable.
